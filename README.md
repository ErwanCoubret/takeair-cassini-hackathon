# Take*Air* Github Repository

This project was realised in the context of the [Cassini Hackathon](https://www.cassini.eu/hackathons/) in 2025 for its 9th edition.

## The pitch (it's a hackathon you know)

Climate conditions can severely impact seniorsâ€™ health and well being, especially those with preexisting conditions.

But right now, most tools aren't built with their specific needs in mind.

So we created **Take*Air***, a mobile health app that helps seniors to go out safely using localized climate data and recommendations tailored to their profile.

## Project Structure

**See the live demo [here](https://takeair.vercel.app/)**

This repository is splitted into two parts:
- The `data` folder contains the processes to get data from Copernicus system and to process it based on **a Jupyter notebook** and **Python scripts**.
- The `takeair-website` folder contains the web application based is based on **NextJS Framework** that corresponds to the live demo, showing Home, Map and Profile pages.

### Data

To get all the required libraries, you can use the `requirements.txt` at the root of the `data` folder.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then launch the Jupyter notebook cells.

### TakeAir Website

To get all the required libraries and install dependencies, run this command in the `takeair-website` folder:

```
npm install
```

and then to launch the website, run:

```
npm run dev
```
